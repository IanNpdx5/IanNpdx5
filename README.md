- 👋 Hi, I’m @IanNpdx5
- 👀 I’m interested in coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more JS, HTML, CSS, and some SQL on khanacademy
- ⬇ I have the basics down so I'm just learing extras but I haven't combined HTML with JS yet but I've done it with CSS
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I play the cello 🎻
